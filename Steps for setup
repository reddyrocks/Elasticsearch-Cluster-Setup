Elasticsearch Cluster
Create 3 vms and change the host name
es-client-01
es-master-01
es-data-01

Go to the /etc/hosts on all nodes and make entries for all the nodes for the hostnames
like 
ip addr host-name


Setting up the client node
a) Install Latest Java
b)check java version
	java -version
c) Install elasticsearch
d) check elasticsearch installed or not
	curl https://localhost:9200
imp configuarations  elasticsearch.yml file on node 1 i.e es-client-01
##node section
cluster.name devops-production
node.name: es-client-01
node.client: true
node.data: false
##discover section
discoverry.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts: ["es-client-01", "es-master-01",  "es-data-01"]
###system level config 
/etc/security/limits.conf 

It is recommended to have the heap size as half as the RAM. This tutorial is based on 1 GB RAM VM. So we will configure 512 MB swap space.

You need to set an environment variable for elasticsearch heap size. You can do this by editing the /etc/environment file. The file should look like the following.


PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games"
ES_HEAP_SIZE="512M"
